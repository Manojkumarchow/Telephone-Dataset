# Telephone-Dataset
Calculated the performance of different classifiers and some ensemble classifiers using Voting Process
Classifiers:
  1. K-NN
  2. SVM
  3. Decision Tree
  4. Naive Bayes
  5. Random Forest
  6. AdaBoost
  7. Gradient Boost
We will get different accuracy rates depending upon the train and test split. I have also uploaded the different Run Results when ran on the  local machine.
